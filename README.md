# deepRL_traffic_UXsim
Testing deep learning methods on a simulated environment based on Nicholasville Rd in Lexington, KY and created using the UXsim python library.
---

This is an ongoing project that will serve as my capstone for a Master's in Data Science degree.

## Goals
- Create a realistic model of Nicholasville Rd with low, medium, and high traffic congestion.
- Implement deep learning methods to interact with the custom gymnasium environment.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the learning rate.
- Evaluate the performance of each model on all three traffic levels and anlayze how and why models performed as they did.
