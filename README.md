# deepRL_traffic_UXsim
Deep learning, Gymnamsium-compatible environment using UXsim traffic simulation
---

This environment was created to test the Proximal Policy Optimization RL method on its ability reduce traffic congestion and increase efficiency through traffic signal control

## Goals
- Create a realistic model of Nicholasville Rd with low, medium, and high traffic congestion.
- Implement deep learning methods to interact with the custom gymnasium environment.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the learning rate.
- Evaluate the performance of each model on all three traffic levels and anlayze how and why models performed as they did.
